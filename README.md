# Expense-Tracker-VueJs

This Vue.js project is an Expense Tracker built using the Composition API. It allows users to add, view, and remove expenses. The app has the following core functionalities:

Add Expense: Users can input an expense name and amount, then add it to the expense list.
Expense List: Displays all the added expenses along with their names and amounts.
Remove Expense: Users can remove individual expenses from the list.
Total Calculation: The total amount of all listed expenses is automatically calculated and displayed.
The project utilizes Vue's reactive ref to manage the state (expense data) and computed to calculate the total amount dynamically. The layout includes simple HTML forms and uses scoped CSS for basic styling.
